## Introduction to C++

C++ is one of the most powerful programming languages, providing flexibility for both **low-level memory manipulation** and **high-level object-oriented design**.  

### Why Learn C++?
1. **System Programming**: Ideal for creating operating systems, compilers, and game engines.
2. **Efficiency**: Offers fine-grained control over hardware resources.
3. **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Provides ready-to-use data structures and algorithms.
4. **Wide Industry Use**: Used in domains like finance, gaming, and robotics.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Syntax and Structure**: Basics of writing, compiling, and running a C++ program.
- **Data Types and Variables**: Integer, float, char, string, etc.
- **Control Flow**: If-else, loops, switch-case.
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions, recursion, inline functions.

## Data Structures

Data structures form the backbone of efficient programming. They help store and organize data for quick access and modification.

### Topics Covered in Detail:
1. **Arrays**
   - Sequential memory allocation.
   - Operations: Traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching.
   - Applications: Matrix manipulation, prefix sums.

2. **Linked List**
   - **Singly Linked List**: Linear connections, dynamic size.
   - **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes with forward and backward pointers.
   - **Circular Linked List**: Last node points back to the first.

3. **Stacks**
   - LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure.
   - Applications: Undo functionality, parsing expressions.

4. **Queues**
   - FIFO (First In, First Out) structure.
   - Types: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue.

5. **Trees**
   - Non-linear hierarchical structure.
   - Types: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, Heaps.
   - Applications: Database indexing, Huffman encoding.

6. **Graphs**
   - Representing relationships (nodes and edges).
   - Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and Floyd-Warshall.

7. **Hashing**
   - Efficient data retrieval using hash tables.
   - Collision resolution strategies: Chaining and open addressing.

8. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
   - Optimizing recursive solutions using memoization and tabulation.
   - Famous Problems: Fibonacci sequence, Longest Common Subsequence.

## Algorithms

Algorithms are well-defined steps to solve computational problems. Mastering them is crucial for competitive programming and real-world applications.

### Topics Covered in Detail:
1. **Sorting Algorithms**
   - Comparison-based: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort.
   - Non-comparison-based: Counting Sort, Radix Sort.

2. **Searching Algorithms**
   - **Linear Search**: Sequential search for unsorted data.
   - **Binary Search**: Efficient search for sorted data.

3. **Divide and Conquer**
   - Break problems into smaller sub-problems, solve recursively, and combine.
   - Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort.

4. **Greedy Algorithms**
   - Make locally optimal choices to achieve global solutions.
   - Examples: Activity Selection, Huffman Coding.

5. **Backtracking**
   - Trial-and-error approach to solve constraint satisfaction problems.
   - Examples: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver.

6. **Graph Algorithms**
   - Shortest Path: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford.
   - Minimum Spanning Tree: Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP enables modular and reusable code by organizing data and behavior into objects.

### Core Principles Explained:
1. **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit.
2. **Abstraction**: Exposing essential details while hiding implementation complexities.
3. **Inheritance**: Reusing properties and methods from a parent class in derived classes.
4. **Polymorphism**: Ability of functions or operators to behave differently in different contexts.

### Advanced OOP Topics:
- **Virtual Functions**: Achieving runtime polymorphism.
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: Creating blueprints for classes.
- **Operator Overloading**: Customizing operator behavior.
- **Templates**: Writing generic code for multiple data types.

2. **File Handling**
   - Stream-based reading and writing to files.
3. **Multithreading**
   - Create concurrent programs with threading libraries.
4. **Move Semantics**
