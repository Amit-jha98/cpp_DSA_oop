## Introduction to C++

C++ is one of the most powerful programming languages, providing flexibility for both **low-level memory manipulation** and **high-level object-oriented design**.  

### Why Learn C++?
1. **System Programming**: Ideal for creating operating systems, compilers, and game engines.
2. **Efficiency**: Offers fine-grained control over hardware resources.
3. **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Provides ready-to-use data structures and algorithms.
4. **Wide Industry Use**: Used in domains like finance, gaming, and robotics.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Syntax and Structure**: Basics of writing, compiling, and running a C++ program.
- **Data Types and Variables**: Integer, float, char, string, etc.
- **Control Flow**: If-else, loops, switch-case.
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions, recursion, inline functions.

## Detailed C++ Concepts

### Memory Management
1. **Stack Memory**
   - Automatic allocation/deallocation
   - Fixed size, faster access
   - Used for local variables

2. **Heap Memory**
   - Dynamic allocation using `new/delete`
   - Manual memory management
   - Used for runtime-sized data structures

3. **References vs Pointers**
   - References: Aliases to existing variables
   - Pointers: Store memory addresses
   - Smart pointers: `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`

### Advanced Features
1. **Exception Handling**
   ```cpp
   try {
       // risky code
   } catch (exception& e) {
       // handle error
   }
   ```

2. **Templates**
   - Function templates
   - Class templates
   - Variadic templates
   - SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)

3. **STL Containers Deep Dive**
   - **Sequence Containers**
     - `vector`: Dynamic array
     - `deque`: Double-ended queue
     - `list`: Doubly-linked list
   - **Associative Containers**
     - `set/multiset`: Sorted unique/non-unique elements
     - `map/multimap`: Key-value pairs
   - **Unordered Containers**
     - `unordered_set/map`: Hash-based containers

## Data Structures

Data structures form the backbone of efficient programming. They help store and organize data for quick access and modification.

### Detailed Theory:
1. **Arrays**
   - Sequential memory allocation.
   - Fixed size, with elements stored contiguously.
   - Common operations include traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching.
   - Applications: Used in problems like matrix manipulation and prefix sums.

2. **Linked List**
   - A linear data structure where elements (nodes) are linked using pointers.
   - Types:
     - **Singly Linked List**: Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
     - **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes contain pointers to both the previous and next nodes.
     - **Circular Linked List**: Last node points to the first node, forming a circle.
   - Advantages: Dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion.

3. **Stacks**
   - LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure.
   - Operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`.
   - Applications: Undo functionality in text editors, parsing expressions, backtracking algorithms.

4. **Queues**
   - FIFO (First In, First Out) structure.
   - Types:
     - **Simple Queue**: Basic enqueue and dequeue.
     - **Circular Queue**: Overcomes the limitation of unused space in arrays.
     - **Priority Queue**: Elements are dequeued based on priority.

5. **Trees**
   - Hierarchical structure with nodes connected by edges.
   - Types:
     - **Binary Trees**: Each node has at most two children.
     - **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Left child < root < right child.
     - **AVL Trees**: Self-balancing BST.
     - **Heaps**: Specialized tree-based data structure for priority queues.
   - Applications: Database indexing, Huffman coding.

6. **Graphs**
   - Represent relationships between entities using nodes (vertices) and edges.
   - Representations:
     - **Adjacency Matrix**
     - **Adjacency List**
   - Key algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and Floyd-Warshall.

7. **Hashing**
   - Efficient data retrieval using hash functions.
   - Resolving collisions:
     - **Chaining**: Use linked lists.
     - **Open Addressing**: Probing techniques (linear, quadratic).

8. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
   - Optimizes recursive solutions by storing intermediate results.
   - Examples:
     - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
     - Knapsack Problem

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP enables modular and reusable code by organizing data and behavior into objects.

### Detailed Theory:
1. **Encapsulation**

   - Benefits: Data hiding and modularity.

2. **Abstraction**
   - Focus on essential details, hiding complexity.
   - Achieved via abstract classes and interfaces.

3. **Inheritance**
   - Reuse code from base classes in derived classes.
   - Types:
     - Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid.

4. **Polymorphism**
   - Ability of methods to perform different actions based on the object.
   - Achieved through method overloading (compile-time) and overriding (runtime).

5. **Advanced Topics**
   - **Virtual Functions**: Support runtime polymorphism.
   - **Templates**: Write generic and reusable code.
   - **Operator Overloading**: Customize the behavior of operators for user-defined types.

### SOLID Principles
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - A class should have only one reason to change

2. **Open/Closed Principle**
   - Open for extension, closed for modification

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**
   - Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes

4. **Interface Segregation**
   - Many specific interfaces better than one general

5. **Dependency Inversion**
   - Depend on abstractions, not concretions
