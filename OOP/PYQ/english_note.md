---

### 🔍 **1. Need for Clear and Concise Technical Writing**

* **Clarity** ensures the message is understood without confusion.
* **Conciseness** eliminates unnecessary words to keep writing brief and relevant.
* Technical documents are often used in decision-making, troubleshooting, or user guidance — clarity is non-negotiable.

**Example:**
❌ *The machine which is utilized for making paper is located in the eastern part of the room.*
✅ *The paper-making machine is in the east section of the room.*

---

### 🧱 **2. Attributes of Good Technical Writing**

* **Accuracy**: Facts must be correct.
* **Brevity**: Say more with fewer words.

| Technical   | Experts in the field | Detailed technical info |
| Managerial  | Decision makers      | Summary, ROI, impacts   |
| General     | Laypersons or public | Simple, minimal jargon  |

---

### 💬 **6. Expressing vs Impressing**

* **Expressing**: Primary aim of technical writing. Focus on clarity and usefulness.
* **Impressing**: Should be avoided. Flowery language or jargon impresses but doesn't communicate.

---

### 🧠 **7. Grammar for Technical Accuracy**

* Correct use of parts of speech ensures meaning is not distorted:

#### ➤ Noun:

* Identify subjects and objects clearly.
* *The machine failed* (clear) vs. *The failure occurred* (passive).

#### ➤ Pronoun:

* Use precise antecedents.
* ❌ *They installed the software and it crashed.* (Who is “they”? What is “it”?)
* ✅ *The technicians installed the software. The software crashed.*

#### ➤ Verb:

* Use strong, active verbs.
* *Check the voltage* vs. *A check of voltage should be conducted.*

#### ➤ Adjective and Adverb:

* Use sparingly and only when needed.
* Adjective: *A high-speed motor*
* Adverb: *Quickly shut off the valve*

#### ➤ Tense:

* **Present Tense**: Facts (e.g., "Water boils at 100°C")
* **Past Tense**: Completed experiments (e.g., "The test showed...")
* **Future Tense**: Proposals (e.g., "We will evaluate...")

#### ➤ Punctuation:

* Use punctuation to aid clarity, not confuse.
* Use commas, semicolons, and colons accurately.
* Bullet lists and numbered points should be parallel in structure.
