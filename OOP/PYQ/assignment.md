### **Q.1: What are the main differences between C and C++ programming languages?**

#### **Introduction:**

**C Language**  
C is a high-level, general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s. It is widely used for system-level programming, such as developing operating systems, embedded systems, and hardware drivers. C follows a top-down approach and emphasizes functions and procedures.

**C++ Language**  
C++ is an extension of the C language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. C++ introduces features like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, which make it suitable for developing large and complex software systems.

---

#### **Differences between C and C++:**

| Feature | C | C++ |
|--------|---|-----|
| **Programming Paradigm** | Procedural | Object-Oriented (also supports procedural) |
| **Focus** | Focuses on functions and procedures | Focuses on objects and classes |
| **Data Security** | No data hiding | Supports encapsulation and data hiding using access specifiers |
| **Code Reusability** | Limited | High, due to features like inheritance and polymorphism |
| **Function Overloading & Operator Overloading** | Not supported | Supported |
| **Standard Input/Output** | Uses `printf()` and `scanf()` | Uses `cin` and `cout` |
| **Memory Management** | Uses `malloc()` and `free()` | Uses `new` and `delete` |
| **Namespace** | Not available | Available (helps avoid naming conflicts) |
| **Inheritance & Polymorphism** | Not supported | Fully supported |
| **File Extension** | `.c` | `.cpp` |

---

**Conclusion:**  
C is best suited for hardware-level and system programming, where performance and memory control are critical. C++ is ideal for application-level development, offering more features and better code organization through object-oriented principles.

### **Q.2.**  
---

### **Q.2: Differentiate between procedural, non-procedural, and object-oriented programming languages. Include their advantages and disadvantages.**

#### **Introduction:**

Programming languages can be categorized based on how problems are approached and solved. The most common paradigms are:

- **Procedural Programming Languages**: Follow a step-by-step approach, focusing on procedures and routines.
- **Non-Procedural (Declarative) Languages**: Focus on what needs to be done, not how itâ€™s done.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Languages**: Organize code using objects that combine data and behavior.

---

#### **1. Procedural Programming**

**Definition:**  
A paradigm based on the concept of procedure calls, where programs are structured into functions and procedures.

**Examples:** C, Pascal, BASIC

**Advantages:**
- Easy to understand for small programs
- Efficient performance
- Simpler memory management

**Disadvantages:**
- Difficult to manage large codebases
- Poor data security (no data hiding)
- Limited reusability

---

#### **2. Non-Procedural (Declarative) Programming**

**Definition:**  
In non-procedural languages, the programmer specifies *what* the program should accomplish without detailing *how* to do it.

**Examples:** SQL, Prolog, HTML

**Advantages:**
- Easier to write for complex logic
- Focuses on outcome rather than implementation
- Can be more concise

**Disadvantages:**
- Less control over how things are done
- Not ideal for all types of applications
- Harder to debug and trace logic

---

#### **3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

**Definition:**  
A paradigm that organizes software design around data (objects), which contain both data and the functions that operate on that data.

**Examples:** C++, Java, Python, C#

**Advantages:**
- Code reusability through inheritance
- Better data security via encapsulation
- Easier to manage large codebases
- Supports modular design and abstraction

**Disadvantages:**
- Can be more complex to design
- Slightly slower performance compared to procedural code
- Requires a deeper understanding of concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

---

#### **Comparison Table:**

| Aspect | Procedural | Non-Procedural | Object-Oriented |
|--------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Focus** | Functions & procedures | Logic & results | Objects & classes |
| **Data Handling** | Global data sharing | Not emphasized | Encapsulated in objects |
| **Reusability** | Low | Low | High |
| **Control** | High | Low | Medium |
| **Examples** | C, Pascal | SQL, Prolog | C++, Java |

---

**Conclusion:**  
Each paradigm serves different needs: procedural languages are simple and fast, non-procedural languages focus on logical outcomes, and OOP languages provide powerful tools for building maintainable and scalable applications.

---
---

### **Q.3.**  
---

### **Q.3: What are the features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? Also explain the advantages of OOP.**

#### **Introduction:**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. OOP helps in modeling complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components.

---

#### **Key Features of OOP:**

1. **Encapsulation:**  
   - **Definition:** Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class.  
   - **Purpose:** It hides the internal state of the object from the outside world, exposing only what is necessary through a public interface.  
   - **Example:** A class representing a bank account that exposes deposit and withdraw methods while keeping the balance variable private.

2. **Data Abstraction:**  
   - **Definition:** Data abstraction involves exposing only the relevant details of an object while hiding the unnecessary implementation details.  
   - **Purpose:** It simplifies complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, reducing complexity and isolating impact of changes.
   - **Example:** An abstract class `Shape` that defines a method `draw()` without detailing how each shape (circle, rectangle) implements it.

3. **Inheritance:**  
   - **Definition:** Inheritance allows a class (child or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent or base class).  
   - **Purpose:** It promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.  
   - **Example:** A `Vehicle` class can be inherited by `Car` and `Bike` classes, which reuse common properties like speed and fuel capacity while adding specific features.

4. **Polymorphism:**  
   - **Definition:** Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is mainly achieved through method overriding and overloading.  
   - **Purpose:** It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms, thereby increasing the flexibility and integration of code.  
   - **Example:** A function `printDetails()` can work differently based on whether the object is of type `Student` or `Teacher`, each providing its own implementation.

5. **Function Overloading:**  
   - **Definition:** Function overloading allows multiple functions to have the same name but different parameters (number or type).  
   - **Purpose:** It enhances readability and usability by allowing the same function name to perform similar tasks with different inputs.  
   - **Example:** Two functions named `add()` where one adds two integers and the other adds two floating-point numbers.

6. **Function Overriding:**  
   - **Definition:** Function overriding occurs when a derived class provides a specific implementation of a function that is already defined in its base class.  
   - **Purpose:** It allows a class to modify or extend the behavior of its base class.  
   - **Example:** A derived class `Dog` might override the `makeSound()` method inherited from a base class `Animal` to provide a specific implementation.

7. **Dynamic Binding (Late Binding):**  
   - **Definition:** Dynamic binding is the process where the code to be executed in response to function calls is determined at runtime rather than at compile time.  
   - **Purpose:** It supports runtime polymorphism, allowing methods to be overridden and the correct method to be called based on the object type.  
   - **Example:** Using a pointer of type `Animal*` to refer to objects of derived classes like `Dog` or `Cat` and calling their overridden methods.

8. **Message Passing:**  
   - **Definition:** Message passing is the communication between objects where an object sends a message (call a method) to another object to request an action.  
   - **Purpose:** It decouples objects and allows them to interact in a modular fashion.  
   - **Example:** An object representing a user interface sending a message to a database object to retrieve data when a button is clicked.

---

#### **Advantages of OOP:**

- **Modularity:**  
  The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, objects can be easily integrated into larger systems.

- **Reusability:**  
  Through inheritance and polymorphism, objects and classes can be reused in different programs, reducing redundancy and increasing efficiency.

- **Scalability and Maintainability:**  
  OOP makes it easier to manage and modify large codebases. Changes in one part of the application have minimal impact on others because of encapsulation and modular design.

- **Improved Collaboration:**  
  OOP enables multiple developers to work on different objects or modules concurrently, leading to faster development cycles and easier code integration.

- **Real-World Modeling:**  
  OOP concepts closely map to real-world entities, making the development process more intuitive and the resulting software easier to understand and extend.

### **Q.4.**  
Define the following terms:  
(a) Input/Output in C++  
(b) Tokens  
(c) Keywords  
(d) Identifiers  

---

### **(a) Input/Output in C++**

**Definition:**  
Input and Output (I/O) operations in C++ are used to take input from the user and display output to the screen.  
C++ uses **streams** to perform I/O:
- `cin` â†’ for standard input (usually keyboard)
- `cout` â†’ for standard output (usually monitor)
- Both are part of the `<iostream>` library.

**Key Concepts:**
- `cin` stands for "console input".
- `cout` stands for "console output".
- Both use **insertion (`<<`)** and **extraction (`>>`)** operators.

**Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age;

    cout << "Enter your age: "; // Output
    cin >> age;                 // Input

    cout << "You are " << age << " years old." << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **(b) Tokens**

**Definition:**  
A **token** is the smallest meaningful unit of a C++ program.  
The compiler breaks a program into tokens to understand it.

**Types of Tokens:**
1. **Keywords** (e.g., `int`, `return`)
2. **Identifiers** (e.g., variable names)
3. **Constants** (e.g., `5`, `3.14`)
4. **Operators** (e.g., `+`, `-`)
5. **Separators/Punctuators** (e.g., `{}`, `;`)

**Example:**
```cpp
int num = 10;
```
**Tokens:**
- `int` â†’ Keyword  
- `num` â†’ Identifier  
- `=` â†’ Operator  
- `10` â†’ Constant  
- `;` â†’ Separator

---

### **(c) Keywords**

**Definition:**  
**Keywords** are reserved words in C++ that have a predefined meaning and cannot be used for variable names or other identifiers.

**Examples of Keywords:**
- `int`, `float`, `if`, `else`, `return`, `while`, `class`, `public`, etc.

**Rules:**
- Keywords are case-sensitive (`int` is valid, `Int` is not).
- Cannot be redefined by the programmer.

**Example:**
```cpp
int x = 5;   // 'int' is a keyword
return 0;    // 'return' is also a keyword
```

---

### **(d) Identifiers**

**Definition:**  
**Identifiers** are the names used to identify variables, functions, classes, objects, arrays, etc.

**Rules for Identifiers:**
- Must begin with a letter (Aâ€“Z or aâ€“z) or an underscore (`_`)
- Followed by letters, digits (0â€“9), or underscores
- Cannot use C++ keywords as identifiers
- Case-sensitive (`num` and `Num` are different)

**Example:**
```cpp
int marks = 90;       // 'marks' is an identifier
float percentage = 95.5;  // 'percentage' is an identifier
```

**Invalid Identifiers:**
```cpp
int 1value;    // Error: cannot start with a digit
int class;     // Error: 'class' is a keyword
```

---

## **Summary Table:**

| Term         | Meaning                                                                 | Example                            |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Input/Output | Used to read input and display output using `cin`, `cout`              | `cin >> age; cout << age;`         |
| Tokens       | Smallest elements of a program recognized by the compiler               | `int`, `=`, `x`, `5`, `;`           |
| Keywords     | Reserved words with special meaning in C++                              | `int`, `return`, `if`, `class`     |
| Identifiers  | User-defined names for variables, functions, etc.                       | `marks`, `sum`, `studentName`      |

### **Q.5.**  
---
## ### **Q.5. Explain in detail the C++ Data Types**

---

### **What are Data Types in C++?**

**Definition:**  
Data types in C++ specify the **type of data** that a variable can store. They help the compiler **allocate memory** and determine **what kind of operations** can be performed on the data.

C++ data types are broadly categorized into:

1. **Built-in / Primitive Data Types**  
2. **Derived Data Types**  
3. **User-defined Data Types**

---

## **1. Built-in (Primitive) Data Types**

These are the basic types provided by the language:

| Type     | Description                        | Example     |
|----------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| `int`    | Integer values                     | `int x = 5;`|
| `float`  | Single-precision decimal numbers   | `float y = 3.14;`|
| `double` | Double-precision decimal numbers   | `double z = 5.123456;`|
| `char`   | Single character                   | `char ch = 'A';`|
| `bool`   | Boolean value (`true` or `false`)  | `bool flag = true;`|
| `void`   | Represents "no value" (used in functions) | `void show();`|

---

### **Modifiers with Built-in Types**

Modifiers adjust the size or sign of the data type:

| Modifier        | Used With      | Purpose                             |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| `signed`       | `int`, `char`  | Can store both negative & positive values |
| `unsigned`     | `int`, `char`  | Only positive values                |
| `short`        | `int`          | Smaller range of integers           |
| `long`         | `int`, `double`| Larger range of integers or decimals|

**Example:**
```cpp
unsigned int x = 50;
long double pi = 3.14159265359;
```

---

## **2. Derived Data Types**

These are built from primitive types:

| Type     | Description                              | Example           |
|----------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Array    | Collection of elements of same type      | `int arr[5];`     |
| Pointer  | Stores memory address of another variable| `int *ptr;`       |
| Function | Block of reusable code                   | `int add(int a);` |
| Reference| Alias for another variable               | `int &ref = x;`   |

---

## **3. User-defined Data Types**

Created by the programmer to model complex data:

| Type       | Description                          | Example                    |
|------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `struct`   | Groups different data types          | `struct Student { ... };`  |
| `class`    | Blueprint for objects (OOP)          | `class Car { ... };`       |
| `union`    | Like struct, but memory is shared    | `union Data { ... };`      |
| `enum`     | Set of named integer constants       | `enum Color { RED, BLUE };`|

---

## **Examples of Each Type**

### **Primitive Example:**
```cpp
int age = 20;
float weight = 55.5;
char grade = 'A';
bool isPass = true;
```

### **Derived Example:**
```cpp
int numbers[3] = {1, 2, 3};   // Array
int *ptr = &age;             // Pointer
```

### **User-defined Example:**
```cpp
struct Student {
    int id;
    char name[20];
};

class Car {
    public:
    string model;
};
```

---

## **Size of Data Types (Typical on 64-bit system)**

| Data Type | Size       |
|-----------|------------|
| `char`    | 1 byte     |
| `int`     | 4 bytes    |
| `float`   | 4 bytes    |
| `double`  | 8 bytes    |
| `bool`    | 1 byte     |
| `void`    | 0 bytes    |

> Use `sizeof()` in C++ to check actual size on your system.

```cpp
cout << "Size of int: " << sizeof(int) << " bytes" << endl;
```

---

## **Conclusion**

C++ offers a wide variety of data types that allow you to define and manipulate different kinds of data effectively. Choosing the right data type ensures efficient memory usage and helps prevent logical errors.

---

---

### **Q.6.**  
---
## ### **Q.6: What do we mean by the following in C++?**

---

### **1. Type Modifiers**

**Definition:**  
Type modifiers in C++ are keywords used with basic data types to alter their **size** and/or **sign**. They help define the range of values that a variable can hold.

**Type Modifiers:**
- `signed`
- `unsigned`
- `short`
- `long`

**Used with:**  
`int`, `char`, `float`, `double`

**Examples:**
```cpp
unsigned int a = 25;     // Can store only positive integers
signed char b = -100;    // Can store both negative and positive values
short int c = 32767;     // Smaller range integer
long int d = 1234567890; // Larger range integer
```

---

### **2. Type Casting**

**Definition:**  
Type casting is the **conversion of one data type into another**. It is used when we want to **convert values** explicitly from one type to another.

**Types of Type Casting:**
- **Implicit (Automatic)** â€“ Done by the compiler
- **Explicit (Manual)** â€“ Done using casting operators

**Syntax (Explicit):**
```cpp
(type) expression;
```

**Example:**
```cpp
int a = 5, b = 2;
float result = (float)a / b;  // result = 2.5
```

---

### **3. Constants**

**Definition:**  
Constants are **fixed values** that do not change during program execution. In C++, you can define constants using `const` or `#define`.

**Ways to declare:**
1. **Using `const`:**
```cpp
const float pi = 3.14;
```

2. **Using `#define`:**
```cpp
#define MAX_SIZE 100
```

**Example:**
```cpp
const int age = 18;
age = 20;  // Error: cannot modify a constant
```

---

### **4. Operators**

**Definition:**  
Operators are **symbols** used to perform operations on variables and values.

**Types of Operators in C++:**

| Operator Type         | Example         | Description                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Arithmetic            | `+`, `-`, `*`   | Perform basic math operations        |
| Relational            | `==`, `!=`, `>` | Compare values                       |
| Logical               | `&&`, `||`, `!` | Combine multiple conditions          |
| Assignment            | `=`, `+=`, `-=` | Assign or update variable values     |
| Unary                 | `++`, `--`      | Operate on a single operand          |
| Bitwise               | `&`, `|`, `^`   | Perform bit-level operations         |
| Ternary               | `? :`           | Conditional expressions              |
| sizeof, typecast      | `sizeof(x)`     | Special built-in operators           |

**Example:**
```cpp
int a = 10, b = 5;
int sum = a + b;           // Arithmetic
bool result = a > b;       // Relational
int c = a * b + 2;         // Mixed
```

---

### **5. Strings**

**Definition:**  
Strings are used to store **text data** in C++. There are two common ways to handle strings:

#### (a) **Character Arrays (C-style strings)**
```cpp
char name[] = "John";
```

#### (b) **String Class (`std::string`)**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name = "Alice";
    cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**String Operations (C++ style):**
- `name.length()` â€“ Get string length
- `name.append("text")` â€“ Append text
- `name[0]` â€“ Access characters

---

### **Operator Precedence in C++**

**Definition:**  
Operator precedence determines **which operator is evaluated first** in an expression that has multiple operators.

---

### **Precedence Table (Highest to Lowest)**

| Precedence | Operators                        | Type              |
|------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1          | `()`, `[]`, `.`, `->`            | Highest            |
| 2          | `++`, `--`, `+`, `-`, `!`, `~`    | Unary              |
| 3          | `*`, `/`, `%`                    | Arithmetic         |
| 4          | `+`, `-`                         | Arithmetic         |
| 5          | `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`             | Relational         |
| 6          | `==`, `!=`                       | Equality           |
| 7          | `&&`                             | Logical AND        |
| 8          | `||`                             | Logical OR         |
| 9          | `=`, `+=`, `-=`                  | Assignment         |
| 10         | `,`                              | Comma (lowest)     |

---

### **Example with Precedence:**

```cpp
int a = 5, b = 2, c = 3;
int result = a + b * c;  // Multiplication has higher precedence
// result = 5 + (2 * 3) = 11
```

---

## **Conclusion**

These basic concepts form the foundation of C++ programming. Understanding **modifiers, casting, constants, operators, and strings** allows you to write efficient and clear programs.

### **Q.7.**  
---

## ### **Q.7. Differentiate between a Class and an Object.**

---

### **Class:**

- A **class** is a **blueprint** or **template** for creating objects.
- It defines **data members** (variables) and **member functions** (methods) that operate on those data.
- It does **not occupy memory** until an object is created.

**Example:**
```cpp
class Car {
  public:
    string brand;
    void start() {
      cout << "Car started";
    }
};
```

---

### **Object:**

- An **object** is a **real-world entity** or **instance** of a class.
- When you create an object, memory is allocated.
- You can **access data** and **functions** of a class using objects.

**Example:**
```cpp
Car myCar;        // Object of class Car
myCar.brand = "BMW";
myCar.start();    // Calls the function
```

---

## **Difference Between Class and Object**

| Feature         | Class                               | Object                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Definition      | Blueprint/template for objects       | Instance of a class                  |
| Memory          | No memory is allocated               | Memory is allocated                  |
| Declaration     | Using `class` keyword                | Using class name to create instance |
| Use             | Defines properties and behavior      | Accesses properties and methods      |
| Example         | `class Student { };`                 | `Student s1;`                        |

---

## **Syntax: Class Definition in C++**

```cpp
class Student {
  public:                   // Access specifier
    string name;            // Data member
    int age;

    void display() {        // Member function
      cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
    }
};
```

### **Creating an Object and Using the Class:**

```cpp
int main() {
  Student s1;           // Creating object
  s1.name = "Alice";    // Accessing data
  s1.age = 20;
  s1.display();         // Calling function
  return 0;
}
```

### **Q.8.**  
---

## ### **Q.8: What is an Access Modifier/Specifier in C++?**

---

### **Definition:**

An **access specifier** (or access modifier) in C++ defines the **scope** and **visibility** of class members (variables and functions) to **other parts of the program**.

They control **how and where** the members of a class can be **accessed**.

---

### **Types of Access Specifiers in C++**

1. **public**
2. **private**
3. **protected**

---

## **1. public**

- Members declared under `public` can be **accessed from anywhere** â€” inside or outside the class.
- Commonly used for **functions** that need to be accessible.

**Example:**
```cpp
class Demo {
  public:
    int x;
    void show() {
      cout << "Public x = " << x;
    }
};

int main() {
  Demo d;
  d.x = 10;         // Accessible
  d.show();         // Accessible
}
```

---

## **2. private (Default Specifier)**

- Members declared under `private` can only be **accessed within the class**.
- Not accessible from outside of the class directly.
- Used to **encapsulate** sensitive data.

**Example:**
```cpp
class Demo {
  private:
    int secret;

  public:
    void setSecret(int s) {
      secret = s;
    }

    void getSecret() {
      cout << "Secret: " << secret;
    }
};

int main() {
  Demo d;
  // d.secret = 10;   // Error: private access
  d.setSecret(10);    // OK
  d.getSecret();      // OK
}
```

---

## **3. protected**

- Acts like `private`, but allows **access in derived (child) classes**.
- Mainly used in **inheritance**.

**Example:**
```cpp
class Base {
  protected:
    int val = 42;
};

class Derived : public Base {
  public:
    void show() {
      cout << "Protected val = " << val;  // Accessible here
    }
};

int main() {
  Derived d;
  d.show();          // Accessible via member function
  // d.val = 5;      // Error: protected access
}
```

---

## **Difference Table**

| Specifier   | Access in Class | Access outside Class | Access in Derived Class |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| `public`    | Yes              | Yes                   | Yes                      |
| `private`   | Yes              | No                    | No                       |
| `protected` | Yes              | No                    | Yes                      |

---

### **Default Access Specifier:**

- In **classes**, the default access specifier is **`private`**.
- In **structs**, the default is **`public`**.

```cpp
class MyClass {
  int x;         // private by default
};

struct MyStruct {
  int x;         // public by default
};
```

### **Q.9.**  
---

### **Q.9: Explain the Controlled Structures in C++ with Code and Flowchart**

---

### **What are Controlled Structures?**

Controlled structures in C++ **control the flow** of program execution. They include **decision-making** and **loop control** statements.

They help in making decisions, jumping to specific code blocks, or repeating code based on certain conditions.

---

## **Types of Controlled Structures (Decision-Making Statements):**

---

### **1. if-else Statement**

**Syntax:**
```cpp
if (condition) {
    // executes if condition is true
} else {
    // executes if condition is false
}
```

**Example:**
```cpp
int age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    cout << "Eligible to vote";
} else {
    cout << "Not eligible to vote";
}
```

**Flowchart:**

```
   [Start]
      |
 [Condition?]
  /       \
Yes        No
/           \
[True Block] [False Block]
      |
    [End]
```

---

### **2. Nested if-else**

**Syntax:**
```cpp
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        // Code
    } else {
        // Code
    }
} else {
    // Code
}
```

**Example:**
```cpp
int marks = 85;
if (marks >= 50) {
    if (marks >= 80)
        cout << "Distinction";
    else
        cout << "Passed";
} else {
    cout << "Failed";
}
```

---

### **3. goto Statement**

**Use:** Transfers control to a **label** in the same function.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
goto label;
// some code
label:
   // code to jump to
```

**Example:**
```cpp
int i = 1;
start:
if (i <= 5) {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
    goto start;
}
```

> Note: Use of `goto` is discouraged in modern C++ for clean code structure.

---

### **4. break Statement**

**Use:** Immediately **terminates** a loop or `switch`.

**Example:**
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3)
        break;
    cout << i << " ";
}
// Output: 1 2
```

---

### **5. continue Statement**

**Use:** Skips the current iteration and moves to the **next loop iteration**.

**Example:**
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3)
        continue;
    cout << i << " ";
}
// Output: 1 2 4 5
```

---

### **6. switch Statement**

**Use:** Used when multiple **conditions** depend on the value of a **single variable**.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code
    break;
  case value2:
    // code
    break;
  default:
    // code
}
```

**Example:**
```cpp
int day = 2;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    cout << "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    cout << "Tuesday";
    break;
  default:
    cout << "Other day";
}
```

---

### **Decision-Making Flowchart Example (if-else):**

```
     [Start]
        |
   [Input Value]
        |
   [Condition?]
    /       \
  Yes        No
 /            \
[Do this]    [Do that]
    \         /
      [Continue]
         |
       [End]
```

---

### **Conclusion:**

Controlled structures allow your C++ programs to make decisions and control the execution flow based on conditions. They are essential for implementing logic and loops.

### **Q.10.**  
--- 
Explain the **inline function** in C++.  
How and where (inside or outside the class) can a function be declared as **inline**?
---
In C++, an **inline function** is a function that is expanded in place at the point of its call, rather than being called in the usual way (with the overhead of a function call). This can improve performance for small, frequently used functions by reducing call overhead, though it may increase the binary size if overused. The compiler decides whether to honor the inline request, as itâ€™s a hint, not a mandate.

### Key Points about Inline Functions
1. **Purpose**: Reduces function call overhead (stack frame setup, jumps, etc.) for small functions.
2. **Usage**: Suitable for small, frequently called functions. Large functions or those with loops/recursion are typically not inlined by the compiler.
3. **Keyword**: Declared using the `inline` keyword.
4. **Behavior**: The functionâ€™s code is inserted directly into the callerâ€™s code during compilation, provided the compiler deems it beneficial.
5. **Definition Requirement**: Inline functions must be defined in every translation unit where theyâ€™re used, typically in header files, to avoid linker errors.

### Declaring a Function as Inline
A function can be declared as inline **inside or outside a class**, depending on the context. Hereâ€™s how:

#### 1. **Inside a Class**
When a function is defined within a class definition, it is **implicitly inline** (no need for the `inline` keyword). However, you can explicitly use `inline` for clarity, though itâ€™s redundant.

**Example**:
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Implicitly inline because it's defined inside the class
    void func1() {
        std::cout << "Function 1\n";
    }

    // Explicitly inline (optional, same effect as above)
    inline void func2() {
        std::cout << "Function 2\n";
    }
};
```

- **Where**: The function is defined directly in the class body.
- **Effect**: The compiler treats `func1` and `func2` as inline candidates automatically.

#### 2. **Outside a Class**
A function can be declared in a class and defined outside it, with the `inline` keyword explicitly used in the definition. This requires the definition to be in a header file (or the same translation unit) to ensure itâ€™s available wherever the function is called.

**Example**:
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    void func3(); // Declaration only
};

// Definition outside the class, explicitly inline
inline void MyClass::func3() {
    std::cout << "Function 3\n";
}
```

- **Where**: Declared in the class (header file), defined outside with `inline` in the same header or source file.
- **Effect**: The `inline` keyword tells the compiler to treat `func3` as an inline candidate and ensures the definition is shared across translation units without linker errors.

#### 3. **Standalone Inline Functions (Non-Class)**
For functions not tied to a class, you can declare and define them as inline in a header file.

**Example**:
```cpp
inline void standaloneFunc() {
    std::cout << "Standalone inline function\n";
}
```

- **Where**: Defined in a header file to be included wherever used.
- **Effect**: The function is inlined at call sites, and the definition is shared across translation units.

### Important Notes
- **Header File Requirement**: Inline function definitions (whether inside or outside a class) must be available in every translation unit that uses them. This is why theyâ€™re typically placed in header files, not source files, to avoid undefined reference errors during linking.
- **Compiler Discretion**: Even with the `inline` keyword, the compiler may choose not to inline if the function is too complex or if optimization settings donâ€™t favor it.
- **Linkage**: Inline functions have **external linkage** by default, but multiple definitions across translation units are allowed as long as theyâ€™re identical.
- **Inline vs. Modern Compilers**: Modern compilers often perform automatic inlining (e.g., link-time optimization) even without the `inline` keyword, so its use is less critical today but still useful for explicit intent.

### Example Combining All Cases
```cpp
// MyClass.h
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    // Implicitly inline (defined in class)
    void func1() {
        std::cout << "Function 1\n";
    }

    // Declared in class, defined outside
    void func2();

    // Standalone inline function (not part of class)
    inline void standaloneFunc() {
        std::cout << "Standalone\n";
    }
};

// Defined outside, explicitly inline
inline void MyClass::func2() {
    std::cout << "Function 2\n";
}

// main.cpp
#include "MyClass.h"
int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    obj.func1();      // Inlined (implicit)
    obj.func2();      // Inlined (explicit)
    standaloneFunc(); // Inlined (standalone)
    return 0;
}
```

### Summary
- **Inline Function**: Expands function code at the call site to avoid call overhead.
- **Declaration**:
  - **Inside Class**: Implicitly inline if defined in the class; `inline` keyword optional.
  - **Outside Class**: Declared in class, defined outside with `inline` (typically in a header).
  - **Standalone**: Defined with `inline` in a header file.
- **Key Rule**: Inline function definitions must be visible in every translation unit, so use header files.
- **Compiler Role**: Treats `inline` as a hint and may ignore it based on optimization criteria.

### **Q.11.**  
What is a **static function**? What is its use?  
How can a **member of a class** be declared as **static** (data or function)?  
Explain with the help of **code**.
---
A **static function** in C++ (or similar languages) is a function that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class. It can be called without creating an object of the class and can only access **static data members** or other static functions of the class, as it doesnâ€™t have access to the `this` pointer (which refers to a specific object instance).

### **Key Points about Static Functions**
- **Scope**: Static functions are associated with the class itself, not with any object.
- **Access**: They can be invoked using the class name (e.g., `ClassName::staticFunction()`).
- **Use**: They are used for operations that donâ€™t depend on instance-specific data, such as utility functions, factory methods, or managing static data members.
- **Limitations**: They cannot access non-static members (data or functions) directly since they donâ€™t have an instance context.

### **Static Data Members**
A **static data member** is a single copy of a variable shared by all instances of a class. Unlike regular data members, it exists independently of any object and is initialized only once.

### **Declaring Static Members**
- **Static Data Member**: Declared with the `static` keyword inside the class and initialized outside the class (usually in the source file).
- **Static Function**: Declared with the `static` keyword in the class definition. No special initialization is needed.

### **Code Example**
Below is a C++ program demonstrating static data members and static functions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
public:
    // Static data member declaration
    static int count;

    // Non-static data member
    string name;

    // Constructor
    MyClass(string n) : name(n) {
        count++; // Increment count when an object is created
    }

    // Static function declaration
    static int getCount() {
        // Can only access static members
        return count;
        // Cannot access 'name' here (non-static)
        // Example: cout << name; // ERROR
    }

    // Non-static function
    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Total objects: " << count << endl;
    }
};

// Static data member initialization (outside class)
int MyClass::count = 0;

int main() {
    // Call static function without creating an object
    cout << "Initial object count: " << MyClass::getCount() << endl;

    // Create objects
    MyClass obj1("Object1");
    MyClass obj2("Object2");

    // Call static function again
    cout << "Object count after creating objects: " << MyClass::getCount() << endl;

    // Call non-static function using objects
    obj1.display();
    obj2.display();

    return 0;
}
```

### **Explanation of the Code**
1. **Static Data Member**:
   - `static int count;` is declared inside the class to keep track of the number of objects created.
   - It is initialized outside the class as `int MyClass::count = 0;`.
   - All objects share the same `count`, and itâ€™s incremented in the constructor.

2. **Static Function**:
   - `static int getCount()` is a static function that returns the value of `count`.
   - It can be called without an object (e.g., `MyClass::getCount()`).
   - It cannot access `name` (a non-static member) because it doesnâ€™t belong to any specific object.

3. **Non-Static Function**:
   - `void display()` is a regular member function that can access both `name` (instance-specific) and `count` (shared static member).

4. **Output**:
   ```
   Initial object count: 0
   Object count after creating objects: 2
   Name: Object1, Total objects: 2
   Name: Object2, Total objects: 2
   ```

### **Use Cases of Static Members**
- **Static Data Members**: To maintain shared data across all objects, like counters, configuration settings, or shared resources.
- **Static Functions**: For utility functions (e.g., `Math::abs()`), factory methods, or accessing/manipulating static data without needing an object.

This approach ensures efficient memory usage and provides a way to organize code that doesnâ€™t depend on object instances.

### **Q.12.**  
(a) What do we mean by the following?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Static Function  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Friend Function  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Constant Function  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Virtual Function  

(b) What are the **advantages** of friend functions?

(c) What are the **guidelines** that should be followed while using friend functions?

(d) **Differentiate** between **friend function** and **member function**.
---

---

### **(a) What do we mean by the following?**

- **Static Function**:  
  A static function in a class is shared by all objects of that class. It does **not have access to `this` pointer** and can only access **static data members** or call other static functions.

- **Friend Function**:  
  A friend function is a **non-member function** that has access to the **private and protected members** of a class. It is declared using the keyword `friend` inside the class.

- **Constant Function**:  
  A constant member function is one that **does not modify any data members** of the class. It is declared by placing `const` after the function declaration:
  ```cpp
  void show() const;
  ```

- **Virtual Function**:  
  A virtual function is a member function that is **declared using the keyword `virtual`** and is meant to be **overridden in derived classes**. It enables **runtime polymorphism**.

---

### **(b) Advantages of Friend Functions:**

1. **Access to Private Data**: Can access private/protected members of a class.
2. **Improves Encapsulation**: Allows controlled access without exposing internal details.
3. **Useful in Operator Overloading**: Especially for binary operators that require access to both operands.
4. **Enhances Flexibility**: Can operate on multiple objects or different classes together.

---

### **(c) Guidelines for Using Friend Functions:**

1. **Use Sparingly**: Only when necessary, as it breaks encapsulation.
2. **Declare Clearly**: Use the `friend` keyword in the class where access is needed.
3. **Avoid Overuse**: Frequent use may indicate poor class design.
4. **Access Rights**: Friend functions are **not inherited** and should be used responsibly.

---

### **(d) Difference Between Friend Function and Member Function:**

| Aspect               | **Friend Function**                                       | **Member Function**                                        |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Membership           | Not a member of the class                                 | Member of the class                                         |
| Access to Members    | Accesses private/protected members via `friend` keyword   | Has automatic access to all members of the class            |
| Declaration          | Declared with `friend` keyword inside the class           | Declared normally inside the class                          |
| Syntax to Call       | Called like a normal function                             | Called using object or pointer to object                    |
| Inheritance          | Not inherited                                             | Inherited by derived classes                                |
| Uses `this` Pointer  | Does not use `this` pointer                               | Uses `this` pointer to access members                       |

### **Q.13.**  
Explain in detail the concept of **operator overloading**.  
Write a program in C++ to **overload the unary â€˜â€“â€™ operator**.
---
---

### **Operator Overloading in C++**

**Operator Overloading** allows us to redefine the way operators work for **user-defined data types** (like classes). It makes code more intuitive and readable when using operators with objects.

#### **Key Points:**
- Only **existing operators** can be overloaded.
- Overloading **does not change** the operator's precedence or associativity.
- Can be **member functions** or **friend functions**.
- Syntax:
  ```cpp
  return_type operator<op>(parameter_list);
  ```

---

### **Unary Operator Overloading Example (`-` operator)**

We can overload the unary minus (`-`) operator to negate the value(s) of an object.

#### **Program:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Number {
private:
    int value;

public:
    Number(int v = 0) {
        value = v;
    }

    // Overloading unary minus operator
    void operator-() {
        value = -value;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Value: " << value << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Number n1(10);

    cout << "Before overloading:" << endl;
    n1.display();

    -n1;  // Calls overloaded unary minus

    cout << "After overloading:" << endl;
    n1.display();

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Output:**
```
Before overloading:
Value: 10
After overloading:
Value: -10
```

### **Q.14.**  
What is **inheritance**?  
Discuss all the **different types of inheritance** with examples and code.
---
**Inheritance** in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a mechanism where a new class (derived or child class) inherits properties and behaviors (data members and member functions) from an existing class (base or parent class). This promotes code reusability, modularity, and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

### **Key Points about Inheritance**
- The **base class** provides common functionality that derived classes can reuse or extend.
- The **derived class** can add new members or override inherited ones.
- Inheritance supports the "is-a" relationship (e.g., a `Dog` is a `Mammal`).
- Access specifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`) control how members are inherited.

### **Types of Inheritance**
There are five main types of inheritance in C++ (and similar OOP languages):
1. **Single Inheritance**
2. **Multiple Inheritance**
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**

Below, Iâ€™ll explain each type, provide an example, and include a complete C++ code snippet demonstrating all types together.

---

### **1. Single Inheritance**
- **Definition**: A derived class inherits from only one base class.
- **Use Case**: When a class extends a single parent class (e.g., a `Car` inherits from `Vehicle`).
- **Example**: A `Student` class inherits from a `Person` class.

---

### **2. Multiple Inheritance**
- **Definition**: A derived class inherits from more than one base class.
- **Use Case**: When a class needs properties from multiple unrelated classes (e.g., a `Smartphone` inherits from both `Phone` and `Computer`).
- **Note**: Can lead to the "diamond problem" (ambiguity when a class inherits from two classes with a common ancestor), resolved using `virtual` inheritance.
- **Example**: A `Laptop` inherits from both `Device` and `Computer`.

---

### **3. Multilevel Inheritance**
- **Definition**: A class is derived from another derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.
- **Use Case**: To model a hierarchy with increasing specialization (e.g., `Animal` â†’ `Mammal` â†’ `Dog`).
- **Example**: `Engineer` inherits from `Employee`, which inherits from `Person`.

---

### **4. Hierarchical Inheritance**
- **Definition**: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
- **Use Case**: When multiple classes share a common base (e.g., `Circle`, `Rectangle` inherit from `Shape`).
- **Example**: `Car` and `Bike` inherit from `Vehicle`.

---

### **5. Hybrid Inheritance**
- **Definition**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance (e.g., hierarchical and multiple).
- **Use Case**: Complex systems with mixed hierarchies (e.g., a university system with `Student`, `Teacher`, and `TeachingAssistant`).
- **Note**: May involve the diamond problem, requiring `virtual` inheritance for clarity.
- **Example**: A `TeachingAssistant` inherits from both `Student` and `Teacher`, which inherit from `Person`.

---

### **Complete Code Example**
The following C++ program demonstrates all types of inheritance with clear examples:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Base class for multiple and multilevel inheritance
class Person {
public:
    string name;
    Person(string n = "Unknown") : name(n) {}
    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    }
};

// 1. Single Inheritance
class Student : public Person {
public:
    int rollNo;
    Student(string n, int r) : Person(n), rollNo(r) {}
    void displayStudent() {
        display();
        cout << "Roll No: " << rollNo << endl;
    }
};

// 2. Multiple Inheritance
class Device {
public:
    string brand;
    Device(string b = "Generic") : brand(b) {}
    void showDevice() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << endl;
    }
};

class Computer {
public:
    int ram;
    Computer(int r = 4) : ram(r) {}
    void showComputer() {
        cout << "RAM: " << ram << "GB" << endl;
    }
};

class Laptop : public Device, public Computer {
public:

### **Explanation of the Code**
1. **Single Inheritance**:
   - `Student` inherits from `Person`.
   - `Student` adds `rollNo` and uses `Person`â€™s `name` and `display()`.

2. **Multiple Inheritance**:
   - `Laptop` inherits from `Device` (for `brand`) and `Computer` (for `ram`).
   - `Laptop` combines functionality from both parents.

3. **Multilevel Inheritance**:
   - `Employee` inherits from `Person`, and `Engineer` inherits from `Employee`.
   - `Engineer` has access to members from both `Person` and `Employee`.

4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**:
   - `Car` and `Bike` inherit from `Vehicle`.
   - Both share `wheels` but have distinct behaviors (`displayCar`, `displayBike`).

5. **Hybrid Inheritance**:
   - `Teacher` and `Student` inherit from `Person` (using `virtual` to avoid duplicate `Person` copies).
   - `TeachingAssistant` inherits from both `Student` and `Teacher`, combining their properties.

---

### **Output of the Code**
```
1. Single Inheritance Example:
Name: Alice
Roll No: 101

2. Multiple Inheritance Example:
Brand: Dell
RAM: 16GB

3. Multilevel Inheritance Example:
Name: Bob
Employee ID: 1001
Specialization: Software

4. Hierarchical Inheritance Example:
Wheels: 4
Type: Car
Wheels: 2
Type: Bike

5. Hybrid Inheritance Example:
Name: Charlie
Roll No: 102, Subject: Math
```

### **Additional Notes**
- **Access Specifiers**:
  - `public` inheritance: Public and protected members remain accessible (as public/protected).
  - `protected` inheritance: Public members become protected in the derived class.
  - `private` inheritance: Public/protected members become private (rarely used).
- **Diamond Problem**:
  - In hybrid/multiple inheritance, ambiguity arises if two base classes inherit from a common ancestor. Use `virtual` inheritance to ensure only one copy of the base class exists.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use inheritance for "is-a" relationships; prefer composition for "has-a".
  - Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies to maintain clarity.

### **1. Constructor**

#### **Theory**
A **constructor** is a special member function of a class with the same name as the class, used to initialize objects when they are created. It is automatically invoked when an object is instantiated and has no return type (not even `void`). Constructors ensure that an object starts in a valid state by initializing its data members.

#### **Key Points**
- **Purpose**: Guarantees proper initialization of objects, preventing undefined behavior.
- **No Return Type**: Unlike regular functions, constructors donâ€™t return values.
- **Automatic Invocation**: Called when an object is created (e.g., `MyClass obj;`).
- **Overloading**: Multiple constructors can exist with different parameter lists.
- **Use Cases**: Setting initial values, allocating resources (e.g., memory, files), or establishing object invariants.
- **Pitfalls**:
  - Forgetting to initialize data members can lead to undefined behavior.
  - Constructors throwing exceptions require careful handling to avoid partial initialization.
- **Default Behavior**: If no constructor is defined, the compiler provides a default constructor that performs no initialization (unless members have default values).
- **Initializer List**: Constructors can use an initializer list for efficient member initialization (e.g., `MyClass() : member(0) {}`).

#### **Code Example**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
private:
    int id;
    string name;

public:
    // Constructor with initializer list
    MyClass() : id(100), name("Default") {
        cout << "Constructor called, initializing id and name" << endl;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "ID: " << id << ", Name: " << name << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Creating object:" << endl;
    MyClass obj; // Constructor called
    obj.display();
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**
```
Creating object:
Constructor called, initializing id and name
ID: 100, Name: Default
```

#### **Explanation**
- The constructor `MyClass()` uses an initializer list to set `id` to 100 and `name` to "Default".
- Itâ€™s called automatically when `obj` is created.
- The initializer list ensures efficient initialization before the constructor body executes.
- **Why Use It?**: This constructor provides a standard way to create objects with predictable initial values, useful for simple classes or when no customization is needed.

---

### **2. Parameterized Constructor**

#### **Theory**
A **parameterized constructor** accepts parameters to initialize object data members with specific values provided at creation time. It allows flexibility by letting users customize the objectâ€™s state during instantiation.

#### **Key Points**
- **Customization**: Enables objects to be created with user-defined values.
- **Signature**: Defined with parameters (e.g., `MyClass(int, string)`).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Creating objects with specific attributes (e.g., a `Student` with an ID and name).
  - Initializing resources based on input (e.g., file paths, sizes).
- **Overloading**: Can coexist with other constructors if signatures differ.
- **Initializer List**: Often used for efficiency and to initialize const or reference members.
- **Pitfalls**:
  - Missing parameters lead to compilation errors unless defaults are provided.
  - Improper parameter validation can create invalid objects.
- **Explicit Keyword**: Use `explicit` to prevent implicit conversions when passing arguments.
- **Performance**: Avoid unnecessary copies of large objects (e.g., pass strings by `const` reference).
- **Real-World Example**: Creating a `Car` object with a specific model and year.

#### **Code Example**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
private:
    int id;
    string name;

public:
    // Parameterized Constructor
    MyClass(int i, const string& n) : id(i), name(n) {
        if (i < 0) {
            cout << "Warning: Negative ID provided!" << endl;
            id = 0; // Validation
        }
        cout << "Parameterized Constructor called" << endl;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "ID: " << id << ", Name: " << name << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Creating object with parameters:" << endl;
    MyClass obj1(1, "Alice"); // Valid parameters
    obj1.display();

    cout << "\nCreating object with invalid ID:" << endl;
    MyClass obj2(-5, "Bob"); // Invalid ID
    obj2.display();
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**
```
Creating object with parameters:
Parameterized Constructor called
ID: 1, Name: Alice

Creating object with invalid ID:
Warning: Negative ID provided!
Parameterized Constructor called
ID: 0, Name: Bob
```

#### **Explanation**
- The constructor takes an `int` and a `const string&` to initialize `id` and `name`.
- It validates the `id` to ensure itâ€™s non-negative, showing basic error handling.
- The `const string&` prevents unnecessary copying of the string.
- **Why Use It?**: Parameterized constructors are ideal when objects need specific initial states, like configuring a database connection with a hostname and port.

---

### **3. Multiple Constructors**

#### **Theory**
**Multiple constructors** refer to a class having several constructors with different parameter lists (constructor overloading). This allows objects to be created in various ways, enhancing flexibility.

#### **Key Points**
- **Overloading**: Constructors are distinguished by the number or type of parameters.
- **Flexibility**: Supports different initialization patterns (e.g., default, partial, or full initialization).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Creating objects with varying levels of detail (e.g., a `Rectangle` with width only or width and height).
  - Supporting legacy code with multiple creation methods.
- **Delegation**: Constructors can call each other to avoid code duplication (e.g., `MyClass(int i) : MyClass(i, "Default") {}`).
- **Pitfalls**:
  - Ambiguous calls (e.g., same number of parameters with compatible types) cause compilation errors.
  - Too many constructors can make the class harder to maintain.
- **Compiler Choice**: The compiler selects the constructor based on the best match for the provided arguments.
- **Real-World Example**: A `Date` class with constructors for year only, year and month, or year, month, and day.
- **Explicit Constructors**: Use `explicit` to avoid unintended conversions in overloaded constructors.

#### **Code Example**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
private:
    int id;
    string name;
    double value;

public:
    // Constructor 1: No parameters
    MyClass() : id(0), name("Unknown"), value(0.0) {
        cout << "Constructor with no parameters called" << endl;
    }

    // Constructor 2: ID only
    MyClass(int i) : id(i), name("Default"), value(0.0) {
        cout << "Constructor with ID called" << endl;
    }

    // Constructor 3: ID and Name
    MyClass(int i, string n) : id(i), name(n), value(0.0) {
        cout << "Constructor with ID and Name called" << endl;
    }

    // Constructor 4: All parameters
    MyClass(int i, string n, double v) : id(i), name(n), value(v) {
        cout << "Constructor with ID, Name, and Value called" << endl;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "ID: " << id << ", Name: " << name << ", Value: " << value << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Testing multiple constructors:" << endl;
    MyClass obj1;                    // No parameters
    MyClass obj2(2);                 // ID only
    MyClass obj3(3, "Charlie");      // ID and Name
    MyClass obj4(4, "David", 99.9);  // All parameters

    cout << "\nDisplaying objects:" << endl;
    obj1.display();
    obj2.display();
    obj3.display();
    obj4.display();
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**
```
Testing multiple constructors:
Constructor with no parameters called
Constructor with ID called
Constructor with ID and Name called
Constructor with ID, Name, and Value called

Displaying objects:
ID: 0, Name: Unknown, Value: 0
ID: 2, Name: Default, Value: 0
ID: 3, Name: Charlie, Value: 0
ID: 4, Name: David, Value: 99.9
```

#### **Explanation**
- Four constructors provide different ways to initialize `id`, `name`, and `value`.
- The compiler matches the constructor based on the arguments provided.
- Each constructor uses an initializer list for efficiency.
- **Why Use It?**: Multiple constructors make the class versatile, allowing users to create objects with minimal or detailed input, like a `User` class with optional fields.

---

### **4. Copy Constructor**

#### **Theory**
A **copy constructor** creates a new object as a copy of an existing object. It is typically defined as `ClassName(const ClassName&)` and is used when objects are passed by value, assigned, or explicitly copied.

#### **Key Points**
- **Purpose**: Ensures a new object has the same state as the source object.
- **Signature**: Takes a `const` reference to prevent modifying the source.
- **Default Behavior**: If not defined, the compiler provides a shallow copy (member-by-member copy).
- **Deep Copy**: Required for pointers or dynamic resources to avoid shared memory issues.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Copying objects in containers (e.g., `vector<MyClass>`).
  - Passing objects to functions by value.
  - Creating backups of objects.
- **Pitfalls**:
  - Shallow copies of pointers lead to double deletion or dangling pointers.
  - Omitting `const` or reference (`&`) can cause unnecessary copies or errors.
- **When Invoked**:
  - Initialization: `MyClass obj2 = obj1;`
  - Passing by value: `func(obj1);`
  - Returning by value: `return obj1;`
- **Performance**: Deep copying can be expensive; consider move constructors for efficiency.
- **Real-World Example**: Copying a `Matrix` object with dynamically allocated data.

#### **Code Example**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
private:
    int id;
    string* name; // Pointer for deep copy demonstration

public:
    // Parameterized Constructor
    MyClass(int i, const string& n) : id(i) {
        name = new string(n); // Dynamic allocation
        cout << "Parameterized Constructor called" << endl;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) : id(other.id) {
        name = new string(*other.name); // Deep copy
        cout << "Copy Constructor called" << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        delete name;
        cout << "Destructor called for id: " << id << endl;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "ID: " << id << ", Name: " << *name << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Creating original object:" << endl;
    MyClass obj1(1, "Alice"); // Parameterized constructor
    obj1.display();

    cout << "\nCreating copy:" << endl;
    MyClass obj2 = obj1; // Copy constructor
    obj2.display();
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**
```
Creating original object:
Parameterized Constructor called
ID: 1, Name: Alice

Creating copy:
Copy Constructor called
ID: 1, Name: Alice
Destructor called for id: 1
Destructor called for id: 1
```

#### **Explanation**
- The copy constructor creates `obj2` as a deep copy of `obj1`, allocating new memory for `name`.
- Without a deep copy, both objects would share the same `name` pointer, causing issues when deleted.
- The destructor ensures each object cleans up its own memory.
- **Why Use It?**: Essential for classes with dynamic resources, like a `String` class managing a char array, to prevent crashes or memory leaks.

---

### **5. Default Constructor**

#### **Theory**
A **default constructor** is a constructor with no parameters or one where all parameters have default values. It allows object creation without specifying initial values and is provided by the compiler if no constructors are defined.

#### **Key Points**
- **Purpose**: Creates objects in a default state, simplifying instantiation.
- **Compiler-Generated**: If no constructors exist, the compiler provides one that leaves non-static members uninitialized (unless they have default values).
- **Explicit Definition**: Needed when other constructors are defined, as the compiler wonâ€™t provide a default constructor in that case.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Creating arrays of objects (e.g., `MyClass arr[10];`).
  - Using containers like `vector<MyClass>`.
  - Placeholder objects to be initialized later.
- **Pitfalls**:
  - Compiler-generated default constructors donâ€™t initialize primitive members, risking undefined behavior.
  - Defining any constructor disables the compilerâ€™s default constructor.
- **Real-World Example**: A `Point` class with default coordinates (0, 0).
- **Initializer List**: Ensures members are initialized efficiently.
- **Zero Initialization**: For global/static objects, the default constructor may initialize to zero if user-defined.

#### **Code Example**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
private:
    int id;
    string name;

public:
    // Default Constructor
    MyClass() : id(500), name("NoName") {
        cout << "Default Constructor called" << endl;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "ID: " << id << ", Name: " << name << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Creating objects with default constructor:" << endl;
    MyClass obj1; // Default constructor
    MyClass obj2; // Default constructor again

    obj1.display();
    obj2.display();
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**
```
Creating objects with default constructor:
Default Constructor called
Default Constructor called
ID: 500, Name: NoName
ID: 500, Name: NoName
```

#### **Explanation**
- The default constructor initializes `id` to 500 and `name` to "NoName".
- Itâ€™s called for both `obj1` and `obj2` without arguments.
- **Why Use It?**: Default constructors are critical for scenarios requiring simple instantiation, like creating placeholder objects in a game engine (e.g., default `Player`).

---

### **6. Dynamic Constructor**

#### **Theory**
A **dynamic constructor** (a non-standard term) refers to a constructor that allocates memory dynamically (e.g., using `new`) for data members, such as pointers or arrays. Itâ€™s used when objects need flexible or large resources that canâ€™t be determined at compile time.

#### **Key Points**
- **Purpose**: Initializes objects with dynamically allocated resources.
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Typically involves `new` for arrays, strings, or other structures.
- **Destructor Pairing**: Requires a destructor to deallocate memory to prevent leaks.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Managing variable-sized data (e.g., a `Buffer` with a user-defined size).
  - Classes with pointers to large objects (e.g., images, datasets).
- **Pitfalls**:
  - Forgetting to deallocate memory causes leaks.
  - Incorrect copy semantics (shallow copy) can lead to double deletion.
- **Deep Copy**: Often paired with a copy constructor for safe copying.
- **Performance**: Dynamic allocation is slower than stack allocation, so use judiciously.
- **Real-World Example**: A `Matrix` class allocating a 2D array based on input dimensions.
- **Exception Safety**: Ensure allocation failures (e.g., `bad_alloc`) are handled gracefully.

#### **Code Example**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
private:
    int* array;
    int size;

public:
    // Dynamic Constructor
    MyClass(int s) : size(s) {
        if (s <= 0) {
            throw runtime_error("Invalid size");
        }
        array = new int[size]; // Dynamic allocation
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            array[i] = (i + 1) * 10; // Initialize
        }
        cout << "Dynamic Constructor called for size: " << size << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        delete[] array;
        cout << "Destructor called, deallocated array" << endl;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Array (size " << size << "): ";
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            cout << array[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    try {
        cout << "Creating object with dynamic constructor:" << endl;
        MyClass obj(5); // Dynamic constructor
        obj.display();
    } catch (const runtime_error& e) {
        cout << "Error: " << e.what() << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**
```
Creating object with dynamic constructor:
Dynamic Constructor called for size: 5
Array (size 5): 10 20 30 40 50 
Destructor called, deallocated array
```

#### **Explanation**
- The constructor allocates an array of size `s` and initializes it with multiples of 10.
- It includes basic validation to prevent invalid sizes.
- The destructor deallocates `array` to avoid memory leaks.
- **Why Use It?**: Dynamic constructors are essential for classes managing variable-sized resources, like a `String` class or a `List` with dynamic storage.

---

### **7. Destructor**

#### **Theory**
A **destructor** is a special member function named `~ClassName()`, with no parameters or return type, called automatically when an object is destroyed (e.g., goes out of scope or is deleted). It cleans up resources like memory, files, or network connections.

#### **Key Points**
- **Purpose**: Ensures proper cleanup to prevent resource leaks.
- **Automatic Invocation**: Called when:
  - An object goes out of scope (stack-allocated).
  - A dynamically allocated object is deleted (e.g., `delete ptr;`).
- **No Parameters**: Cannot be overloaded.
- **Default Behavior**: Compiler provides a default destructor that does nothing unless members require cleanup.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Deallocating dynamic memory (e.g., pointers).
  - Closing files, sockets, or database connections.
  - Releasing locks or system resources.
- **Pitfalls**:
  - Forgetting to define a destructor for dynamic resources causes leaks.
  - Double deletion or accessing deleted resources leads to undefined behavior.
- **Virtual Destructors**: Essential in inheritance to ensure derived class destructors are called (e.g., `virtual ~Base()`).
- **Order**: Destructors are called in reverse order of constructors (LIFO).
- **Real-World Example**: A `FileHandler` class closing an open file in its destructor.
- **Exception Safety**: Destructors should not throw exceptions to avoid program termination.

#### **Code Example**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
private:
    int id;
    string* resource; // Simulate a resource

public:
    // Constructor
    MyClass(int i) : id(i) {
        resource = new string("Resource_" + to_string(i));
        cout << "Constructor called, allocated resource for id: " << id << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        cout << "Destructor called for id: " << id << ", cleaning up resource" << endl;
        delete resource;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "ID: " << id << ", Resource: " << *resource << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    cout << "Creating objects:" << endl;
    MyClass obj1(1); // Constructor
    obj1.display();

    {
        cout << "\nEntering inner scope:" << endl;
        MyClass obj2(2); // Constructor
        obj2.display();
        cout << "Exiting inner scope" << endl;
    } // obj2's destructor called here

    cout << "\nBack in main, obj1 still exists:" << endl;
    obj1.display();
    // obj1's destructor called at end of main
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**
```
Creating objects:
Constructor called, allocated resource for id: 1
ID: 1, Resource: Resource_1

Entering inner scope:
Constructor called, allocated resource for id: 2
ID: 2, Resource: Resource_2
Exiting inner scope
Destructor called for id: 2, cleaning up resource

Back in main, obj1 still exists:
ID: 1, Resource: Resource_1
Destructor called for id: 1, cleaning up resource
```

#### **Explanation**
- The constructor allocates a dynamic `string` to simulate a resource.
- The destructor deallocates it to prevent memory leaks.
- `obj2` is destroyed when its scope ends, while `obj1` persists until `main` ends.
- **Why Use It?**: Destructors are critical for resource management, like ensuring a `Database` class closes connections when objects are no longer needed.
